For extensions, just install the extensions to regular VS Code and then click the button
in the GUI of the Cursor app in the extensions bar to have it install the extensions.
Unfortunately at the current time of writing the command line method of installing extensions
for Cursor is [not implemented](https://github.com/getcursor/cursor/issues/1985).
